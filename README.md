# Project Outline

### Overview

Have you ever gotten together with your friends and family, been ready to watch a movie or binge your favorite show, just to realize you have no idea which streaming service provides it?  There you are, popcorn popped and getting cold, soda getting flat and watered down, and you’re stuck browsing all your services looking for the one that has that show or movie you just have to see. 

This is the problem my project will aim to solve.  Users will go to one simple home page, with little more than a search bar (a la Google), where they will enter the name of the show or movie in question.  The site will then search Netflix, Hulu, Amazan, etc. on behalf of the user and return the title, service, description, and various other data about the title.  Ideal functionality will link the user directly to the title’s main page on the service, or even to the media itself.  Additionally, the user will be able to create an account (though not mandatory) and create lists for themselves with the site will retain, and we hope to allow for searches by genre, actor, director, etc.

### Features

API's:  Searching 3rd party sites will be easiest if I can find API's to hand this process for me.  It is my understanding many of these sites, especially Netflix, provide these freely.

User Login:  Allowing users to create an account and maintain a profile with their information related to the site.

Search:  Users will be able to search a variety of sites from within this one, and have their results returned to them, still within the site.

Create Lists:  Users will be able to create lists of their shows and movies so that they do not need to search for them again, or remember what they were.

### Technologies

API's:  I was planning on using several different API's (Netflix, Hulu, etc.), but it appears that the individual ones don't exist, except for Netflix, which was depricated a few years ago.  Otherwise, it looks like Guidebox will serve most of my needs.

Java

PHPMyAdmin or SpringData

HTML

CSS

JavaScript

Spring

SpringBoot

Thymeleaf

### What I'll Have to Learn

API's:  I will have to learn to use API's and tailor them to my purposes.

Hosting:  I want to learn to fully set up a website so that anyone my use it.

JavaScript:  It's site connecting people to A/V media - the site should be visually pleasing.

Other things:  I imagine harvesting data from third party sites is harder than just having an API do all the work for you, so I will need to be sure I can sort through that data and display it in the right location, or disregard what is not needed.  Additionally, we have learned about displaying text and links with our frameworks, but we have done little with images and other types of html elements with our frameworks, so I will have to do more research with Spring and Thymeleaf to display those.
